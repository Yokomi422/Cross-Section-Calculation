$prop
        prop_type = "el"  ! "el" for ionization (electron propagator), "pol" for excitation (polarization propagator)
$end

$init
        hs_in = "4" ! number of the HF orbital associated with the decaying state, always as a string, maybe later I find a better way to do it, in the case of excitation you can have a list of orbitals separated by a space "1 2 3"
! In this case, the 4-th orbital corresponds to a innter-valence orbital of the donor water molecule
        ps_in = "0" ! this section should be zero if you do ionization, an orbital number or list of orbitals for excitation "1 2 3"
$end

$final
        h_f_min = 5 ! this is the former ov_min section, where you select the orbitals which you use to construct the final 2h1p states
        h_f_max = 10 ! former ov_max section
        p_f_min = 11 ! former k_min section
        p_f_max = 200 ! former k_max section - use 0 if you want to include all virtual orbitals in the calculation
$end

$control
        n_occ = 10    ! number of occupied orbitals
        n_mo = 241    ! total number of orbitals. 
         This is normally determined automatically from HForbenergy.dat. However, in this case we computed MO intergrals only up to 241, see the TC input and output file.
        gam = "total" ! for ionization you have "total", "singlet", "triplet"
        moint = 0     ! whether to reduce the moint file such that it contains only OOOO, OOOV, OOVV, OVOV integrals; if == 1, only the moint calculation will be done and the selected integrals will be written in moint_red.txt file
        prnt = 0      ! a flag for printing the eigenvalues and eigenvectors for each virtual orbital
        eig_thresh = 0.1 ! a threshold value for printing the eigenvectors
