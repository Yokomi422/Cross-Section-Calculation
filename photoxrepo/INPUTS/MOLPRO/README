This folder contains some sample calculations for Molpro. 
The files are divided to two categories:

Beginner (this folder)
--------
the most basic calculations

- geometry optimization
- interpolation between two structures
- EOM-CCSD excited state calculation

Advanced
--------
You know, how to run a very simple calculation, but you need 
more...

- dynamical weighting using CASSCF
- excited state optimization
- conical intersection optimization
- spin-orbit calculations
- diabatization
