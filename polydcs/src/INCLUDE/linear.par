C
C  Main include file for POLYDCS code.
C
C  The parameters are suitable to be used for a LINEAR molecule.
C
C  This choice of the parameters has been made to optimize memory 
C  allocation on the molecular systems we tested.
C  In general, this set represent a good starting point for similar
C  molecular systems, but using it "as is" without a fine tuning 
C  could produce unpredictable results.
C
C  Parameters meaning:
C
C  maxn    ===>   Storage needed during M matrix calculation
C                 It is proportional to (Lmax * Jmax)**2.
C                 In the case of a linear molecule this is slightly
C                 reduced due to the use of the B matrix.
C  nang    ===>   Max no. of theta angles.
C  ndcs    ===>   Max no. of J transitions to calculate.
C  ngam    ===>   Max no. of terms for the factorial calculation.
C  nlam    ===>   Max value of Lbig (L in the DCS Legendre expansion). 
C  nps     ===>   Max value of L in Born Aproximation. It becomes relevant
C                 only for B matrix calculation, so for non linear 
C                 molecule it is set to 1.
C  npw     ===>   Max no. of partial waves in the input k-matrices.
C  nsym    ===>   Max no. of IRs (a1,a2,...) for a given molecular system
