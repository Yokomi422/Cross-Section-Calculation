  # ------------- The Multiple Active Spaces (MAS) approach -------------------
  #
  # Beyond the predefined models...
  #
  # It is strongly recommended to read the tutorial on the MAS approach, as not
  # all usage aspects are covered below.
  #
  # If 'use_MASSCF' is non-zero then the quantum chemistry calculation is performed using the MASSCF approach.
  # The options setting the orbital spaces above are overridden with the exception of 'nvirtual' and 
  # 'virtual_orbs', MAS must then be used for the target and scattering calculation.
  # If 'use_MAS' is non-zero then the target and scattering calculation is performed using the MAS approach.
  # This option overides the setting of orbital spaces above, except for the total number of orbitals per
  # symmetry read in by scatci_integrals. So the orbitals used in the MAS approach must be less than or equal to
  # 'nfrozen' +  'nactive' + 'nvirtual', but there is no requirement to have the same number of frozen, 
  # active or virtual orbitals as specified above. Any orbitals not included in the MAS description will be
  # considered virtual and contracted along with the continuum.
  'use_MASSCF', 0,  # == 0, don't use MASSCF approach. == 1, use ORMASSCF in Molpro.  == 2, use GASSCF in Molcas.
  'use_MAS',    0,  # == 0, don't use MAS approach. == 1, use ORMAS.  == 2, use GAS.

  # The format for defining the each active space is:
  # [orbs per sym] or orbs_per_subspace, [min_occ, max_occ], /(frozen|closed|active)/
  # where min_occ and max_occ are the local minimum and maximum electron occupancy for 
  # the ORMAS case and the cumulative minimum and maximum occupancy in the GAS case.
  # Note: 'frozen_orbs' above actually refers to closed/inactive orbitals in the quantum 
  # chemistry CASSCF context, not frozen orbitals. In the MAS approach the quantum chemistry
  # nomenclature is used.
